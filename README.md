Mount the board component side down on the bottom of the Arduino Nano.


NanoIO Version 1.3.1
Authors:

An FSK / CW interface based on the Arduino nano. Sketch includes an FSK modulator, a CW computer interface, and a CW iambic-A/B keyer.

FSK Specifications
5 bit Baudot
baud rates 45.45, 50, 75 and 100
CW Specifications:
5 to 100 WPM
dash/dot ratio adjustable 2.5 to 3.5
in-line increment decrement WPM using ^ and | characters
incremental size user adjustable
PTT signal generated by Arduino

Both
an internal buffer of 200 characters is available for buffered transmit.
Hardware requirement
Arduino nano or compatible (author used nano from Elegoo)
LTV-847 quad opto-isolator
4 620 ohm ¼ watt resistor (should work with 500 < R < 820 ohm)
suitable connectors to interface to transceiver

efault pin assignments defined in Arduino Sketch for the above circuit.

D9 / PIN 9 – spare
D10 / PIN 10 – PTT
D11 / PIN 11 - FSK_PIN
D12 / PIN 12 – CW
Default startup configuration
nanoIO 1.0.1
FSK: Baud: 45.45, Mark LOW
CW: WPM: 18/18, dash/dot 3.00, incr 2, IambicA keyer

In line special characters:
Both:

[ PTT on
] PTT off
\ escape; clear internal buffer and set PTT off
CW:

^ increase computer wpm by increment value (default is 2) *
| decrease computer wpm by increment value *
% <SK>
& <AS>
+ <KN>
- <BT>
< <AS>
= <BT>
> <AR>
{ left brace <HM>
} right brace <VE>
* - the ^| wpm modifiers do not effect the paddle CW, just the computer CW.

for example, a CW string might contain:

~C~S24s[tu ^^5nn|| k]
Mode is changed to CW
Computer WPM is set to 24
PTT is set ON
The string “tu “ is sent
Computer WPM is increased by 2 increment factors
The string “5nn” is sent
Computer WPM is decreased by 2 increment factors
The string “ k” is sent
PTT is set OFF
PTT will enable before starting the CW transmission. PTT will disable after the last CW character (k) is completed.
